# Core Components

## Agent System
Agents represent individuals in the simulation with properties:
- Health & Hunger
- Position & Movement
- Reproduction capability
- Neural network brain
- Fitness tracking

## World System
The environment where agents exist:
- Resource distribution
- Terrain types
- Resource regeneration
- Spatial organization

## Evolution System
Handles the genetic evolution of agents:
- NEAT genome management
- Crossover operations
- Mutation handling
- Fitness evaluation

## Neural Networks
Each agent's brain:
- Input layer (environmental sensors)
- Hidden layers (evolved topology)
- Output layer (action decisions)
