# SapiensSim

**SapiensSim** is a high-performance, agent-based simulation designed to model the evolution of human societies based on the core concepts presented in Yuval Noah Harari's "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind."

## Core Concept

This project simulates a population of Sapiens agents whose evolution is driven not just by biological pressures, but by the emergence, transmission, and evolution of "fictions" or "memes." These shared beliefs (e.g., myths, religions, laws, money) allow agents to cooperate in large numbers and overcome biological limitations, leading to complex societal structures.

The simulation uses a genetic algorithm to allow these fictions to evolve organically in response to environmental and social pressures.

## Tech Stack
*   **Language:** Python 3
*   **Core:** NumPy for data structures
*   **Performance:** Numba for JIT compilation of the core simulation loop
*   **Analysis:** Pandas and Matplotlib/Plotly
